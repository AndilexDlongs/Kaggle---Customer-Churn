# Customer Churn Kaggle Competition
 ## Who am I
 Hi I am Andile Dlongwana, an Information Engineering student at the University of the Witwatersrand. I reside in South Africa, Johannesburg to be exact. 
 ## What will I be doing
 In this project I will be attempting the closed kaggle customer churn competition.

 The goal with this project is to master my skills in EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering and be proficient in the simplistic classification models as well as cement my expertise in XGBoost and Nearal Networks. HyperParameter tuning and Cross Validation will be key in the decision making of model progression.

 Apart from the joy of going through the exploratory data and model building journey, I also chose this Kaggle competition because of the relevance in business value. I see this experience as the introductory exposure of my real-world data science career.

 ## How will I Proceed
I will be using an iterative approach in building the prediction models. My aim is to establish a baseline model performance, a benchmark, which will be the basis of my decision making in evaluating the next prediction model I use to experiment.

The evaluation metrics on the Kaggle Competition is Accuracy. I will be using accuracy and F1 score. F1 score will be a more relevant evaluation metric seeing that customer churn rate distribution is never 50%. F1 score will evaluate the models performance by assessing the ability to predict specific categories. 

## High Level Model Building Structure
- model training
- model evaluation (K-Fold, F1, Accuracy)
- model Hyperparameter tuning
